## Welcome

to the BackCap-WEB repository, the frontend component of the [BackCap](https://github.com/Edems-DEV/BackCap) management system of backups. This project is divided into three parts: server, daemon, and web, which is the focus of this repository. Here you will find the source code for the BackCap dashboard, which is built using Angular and ng-bootstrap. The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring and managing backups, and allows users to modify settings and activate machines as needed. We hope you find this project useful for your backup management needs
